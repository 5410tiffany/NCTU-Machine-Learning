ECM9032 Machine Learning Taught By Professor Jen-Tzung Chien in National Chiao Tung University


1. **HW1** includes Bayesian Linear Regression, Linear Regression with Maxiumum Likelihood Approach(ML) and Maximum a posteriori approach(MAP)
2. **HW2** includes Sequential Bayesian Learning and Logistic Regression with with `Fasion_MNIST` datasets datasets
3. **HW3** includes Gaussian Process, Support Vector Machine(SVM) with `Tibetan` datasets, and Gaussian Mixture Model, and K-means

## About the Homework
* Most algorithms are implemeted solely by numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, no advanced toolbox/packages adopted.
* detailed discriptions and demos are **attached in RM files in each folder**

Good Luck!
